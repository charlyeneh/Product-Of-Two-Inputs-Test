> Description of the test.

I developed a simple html page with a navbar, footer and body.
It also has a simple function written with vanilla JavaScript that takes an input of 2 numbers and returns a product of the two inputs. The function is written in such a way as not to allow an input that's not a number. I also wrote a jest test for the function.
